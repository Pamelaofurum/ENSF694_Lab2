 2.	Compare their running times and show them. Which one performed better and why?
 From the execution result below as seen in my result and screenshot attached;
 the Linear Search Running Time: 9100 nanoseconds while 
 the Interpolation Search Running Time: 16600 nanoseconds
 so the Linear Search Running Time performed better as it has a lower time and
 this is as a result of sorting done and also the input data.
 
 
 
 3.Try to improve the running time of the linear search by at least 20% and explain your logic.
  I improved the running time of the linear search by 40% by implementing Transposition and got below output;
 " Linear Search with Transposition Running Time: 5300 nanoseconds"
  So by implementing a Transposition, the linear search running time reduced to 5300 nanoseconds making it more efficient.
  The logic behind the improvement by transposition search is that it reduces the average search time by moving
  the search element one position closer to the array.
